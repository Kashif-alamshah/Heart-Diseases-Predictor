# Heart-Diseases-Predictor
This repository contains a logistic regression model built to predict the likelihood of a person developing heart disease within the next 10 years.The model is trained using a dataset with specific features that are considered most important for predicting heart disease risk. These features are:

age: Age of the individual
cigsPerDay: Number of cigarettes smoked per day
totChol: Total cholesterol level
sysBP: Systolic blood pressure
diaBP: Diastolic blood pressure
BMI: Body Mass Index
heartRate: Heart rate
glucose: Glucose level
Dataset
The dataset used for this model contains multiple health-related metrics, but only the above features are selected due to their high correlation with heart disease risk. The dataset is preprocessed and cleaned to remove any missing or outlier data points before training the model.

Model
A logistic regression algorithm is used to create the model, as it is well-suited for binary classification tasks like predicting whether an individual is likely to develop heart disease.
